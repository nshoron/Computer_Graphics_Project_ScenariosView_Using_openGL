# 🌍 OpenGL Scenario View – E-Village & Smart City Simulation

**OpenGL Scenario View** is a **computer graphics project** developed using **OpenGL**, demonstrating an interactive and animated **virtual environment** that includes an **e-village and smart city**. The scene features dynamic elements such as **rainfall, snowfall, buildings, roads, trees, and environmental transitions**, showcasing core concepts of computer graphics and rendering.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a realistic **2D/3D OpenGL scene** that simulates both **rural and urban environments**. The system demonstrates how OpenGL can be used to render animated scenes, environmental effects, and object transformations to model real-world scenarios.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Design an interactive **OpenGL-based scenario**
* Simulate **e-village and city environments**
* Implement natural effects such as **rain and snowfall**
* Render static and dynamic objects (buildings, roads, trees)
* Demonstrate key **computer graphics concepts**

---

## 🖥️ Scene Description (Proposed System)

The scene is divided into multiple zones:

* **E-Village Area:** Houses, trees, fields, roads
* **City Area:** Multi-story buildings, streets, streetlights
* **Environment Effects:** Rain, snowfall, sky transitions

Users can observe environmental changes and animated elements in a continuous graphical simulation.
